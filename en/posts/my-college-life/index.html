After the senior year, I gradually fell out of school. I only had one class per week. After graduation, I had to say goodbye to my undergraduate life. It is also time to summarize the experience of the university and start a new life.</p><p>After the college entrance examination, the days have become much easier. With new mobile phones and computers, it is more important to spend time doing what you want to do. I can&rsquo;t remember what I did at the time, just remember that my university started with military training.</p><p>Our 16-level undergraduate students were sent to Huairou&rsquo;s base for two weeks of military training, leaving some painful memories. The quilt at the base was very dirty, and I couldn&rsquo;t bring it myself. I had to buy a three-piece set of sheets and a pillowcase, and I could barely sleep with a layer of cloth on the black quilt. Due to the proximity of the mountains in the suburbs, the foggy scenery was very good at that time, and this is the only good place. The usual military training is very bitter, can not bring a mobile phone (should be sneaky in charging the dormitory), hot water supply is limited, only when the hot water is sent at the right time, we take the basin, cup, kettle to go out to pick up the water. It is even harder to wash clothes. I don&rsquo;t really remember how to complete this challenge. I just remember to hang clothes on the square outside a dormitory with a row of clothesline. Fortunately, the clothes are not lost. Every morning (and noon) will be awakened by a sharp whistle, with a 10,000-point unwillingness to get up quickly and stack the quilt and rush out to gather. Huairou’s temperature difference between day and night was very high. She was killed by the sun during the day. One night, it was my turn to watch the night. I felt very cold when I sent a military coat. The canteen is also very magical. There is no chair. When the meal is opened, everyone rushes into the cafeteria. Every ten people surround a table with a pot of steamed buns, a pot of soup, and a few pots of vegetables. After the officer’s training, a whistle sounds. I started eating and eating. The distribution of taro and soup is average, but the meat is very fast, and it is too early to start. After standing to eat, take your own bowl and go to the outside pool to wash (later lazy to buy plastic film stickers, throw plastic film after eating), everyone took turns to clean up the table, and finally lined up back to the dormitory. The whole process of military training is to prepare for the &ldquo;day parade&rdquo; of the last day, kicking the pace, walking the team, and showing it to the leaders on the last day. Unfortunately, I am still not sure about the benefits of military training for individuals.</p><p><img src=%E5%86%9B%E8%AE%AD1.jpg alt>
<img src=%E5%86%9B%E8%AE%AD2.jpg alt></p><center>Huairou military training</center><p>After the military training, I returned to the Hongfu Campus. I am now almost abandoned, and we are talking about the 16th grade or the last grade in Hongfu, Shahe, and the headquarters. The freshman curriculum is tense and there are classes almost every day. Most of the rest of the time is spent on algorithmic competition and enjoying life. I learned the algorithm competition because I felt that I have been playing very well. I should do something meaningful and interesting. I don&rsquo;t like communication and organization activities very much. I want to improve my ability. Starting with Liu Yujia&rsquo;s &ldquo;Introduction to Classics&rdquo;, I later went to brush UvaOJ, but after I made more than one hundred questions, I slowly abandoned the pit, because many people started to learn from high school, and I am now competing with them. However, if you don&rsquo;t take the ACM competition and take the award, the benefits of improving the algorithm&rsquo;s capabilities are many: the courses involved in the algorithm, such as the measurement, algorithm, and data structure, will become very simple; The sensitivity of time and space complexity will also organize you to write very lazy code; when you finally find a job, there is still a high probability that you will be asked the algorithm.</p><p>At that time, the music game also occupied a lot of time for me - when I was in the second year of high school, I had my own smart machine Galaxy S4 mini. I accidentally downloaded the Deemo game that was just produced at that time. It was attracted by its simple and elegant interface, gameplay design and plot. Since then, I have been paying attention to the update of this game, looking forward to the new plot and spectrum, and also fascinated with Rhea&rsquo;s other music game Cytus. Later, I was nervous during the third year of high school, and the experience of playing them on a small 4.3-inch screen was not very good, so I didn’t touch it anymore. When I got to college, I changed into a 5.7-inch S7e. Naturally, I have to make up for this unsatisfied desire. I started the genuine Deemo game and began to relive my old dreams. Looking back at the Deemo album in the space that has been updated from 2014 to 2018, it is also a kind of insistence on this little hobby. After all, high school games can also show off various skills like the students around, the university can only Silently put the FC screenshots into the album one by one, becoming a lonely player (also because their level is not high enough to absorb the powder on the video site).</p><p><img src=./entrance.jpg class=third-img>

I like the class to grab the first row, because the classroom is too big and the back is not clear, the front is also convenient to communicate with the teacher, now think about the fixed seat in the first row, there is a benefit that there may be a girl noticed You hh. High school&rsquo;s material base and serious study, so the high number and line generation mastery is not bad, the program is interested and the machine test is very simple for the algorithm competition, and the written test is relatively water, the score is very high. The good rankings in the last semester made me apply from the network engineering major and transferred to the experimental class. The experimental class was the first time for Beiyou. Now it seems to have advantages and disadvantages. I had a small class with 37 classmates in the experimental class. It also felt that the usual circle was a little smaller, but the classmates were very strong. Take a look at the class schedule of the experimental class: Set theory and mathematical logic, data structure, electronic technology foundation, mathematical analysis, English, and sports, which are also the relative foundations of the computer science field.</p><p>The reforms promoted by the experimental class are to reduce the total credits, delete the unrelated classes and give us more choices in the professional direction. Many other universities have similar settings. This arrangement also has their common problems. After the reform, the class curriculum system is relatively independent of the general profession. Then the distribution of benefits such as rankings/scholarships should be considered separately, because the scores are no longer comparable, but These interests are inconsistent and will conflict with ordinary classes. And there are troubles for students who go abroad: Is it a full-time ranking or an experimental class? Under the same effort, the results in the experimental class are less than the average class, so the use of full-time rankings is not cost-effective, but the number of people in the class is very small, and the graduate school will see what is unknown. But for me, the biggest benefit of the experimental class is more resources. Because it is a small class, and everyone is very smart, the teacher will not slow down the lecture speed or reduce the difficulty because of the level of taking care of the big class, it sounds very cool (but also varies from teacher to teacher).</p><div class=left-third-img markdown=1><img src=./snow.jpg>
<center>First snow</center></div><p>The university is also the first time we have lived with people from Tiannanhaibei. When Beijing first snowed, many southerners who had never seen snow were very curious and even ran out to play, we felt very interesting. Hongfu and Shahe are very remote, but Hongfu’s infrastructure is much worse than Shahe. There is no air conditioning in the dormitory, which is unbearable in the summer. It can only be asleep in the snoring of the small fan attached to the wall. Not having my own table also brought a lot of inconvenience to life. Now I remember that I bought a burger and a cola back to the dormitory to eat, and accidentally sprinkled the cola on the quilt. One of the most enjoyable moments is the National Day of 2016. I have my own laptop and the top version of the MSI GS63. This is the perfect notebook I have in mind at the time, i7-6700HQ + GTX1060 + 16G memory + 256 SSD + 1 T hard drive, only 1.6 kg weight, 18 mm thick, both game-based performance and ultra-thin thin, shortcomings It is not enough to use the battery when you are in class. In the past two years, it still lasted for 4 hours. It may be because it is too often taken out and not plugged in. The battery ages very quickly, and now it only lasts for more than an hour.</p><div class=right-half-img markdown=1><img src=./paper_bridge.jpg>
<center>Paper bridge</center></div><p>Participated in a paper-bridge bearing competition, given a quantity of A4 paper and other materials, to make a bridge that could hold as many objects as possible. I want to think with my friends. He feels that a piece of paper is easy to bend from the front, but it is relatively strong from the side, which means that the side of the paper has a strong bearing capacity. So we decided to cut the paper into a lot of slender strips, stick them together, and load them with the sides. The idea is very good, but the production is a bitter work. It took us several days to cut and paste the paper. The bridge deck we made was not made of plain paper. At the scene of the game, our bridge is the most special one. Everyone else rolls the paper into a barrel. Only we are square and stick to the cube. During the game, a lot of barbells were placed on the bridge. It was going to be as tall as a man, and then the bridge collapsed. It seemed to be the third/fourth. The reason why the bridge collapsed was that the bridge deck was made with flaws, a sticky knot, and the piers on both sides were unevenly stressed.</p><p>During the freshman year, an organization known as the Space Country, ASGARDIA. Founded. They are committed to &ldquo;building a platform for the experimental research of the Earth in outer space and building the world&rsquo;s first space fleet&rdquo; (Baidu Encyclopedia). At the time, I saw the news very excited. I felt that I had to register quickly or not to go to the moon. Soon after the establishment, there were many lively events. He collected the national emblem and the national flag from all citizens and launched our campaign to become the organizer of the place. ASGARDIA will also launch its own satellite, and the first 100,000 registered citizens can submit their own photos and a short paragraph, and the satellite will carry the data to space (has forgotten what I submitted). However, in the past three years, I have forgotten it, and there has not been any movement. The United Nations has not yet recognized its status as a country, let alone a colonial alien. I don&rsquo;t know if it can live to the day when human science and technology are enough to support its goal.</p><p>Finally, Hongfu also encountered two special celestial phenomena, one was November 4, 2016, and it was the largest moon in 70 years (I am very curious about how big the moon was in 1946, or that there is no record before going further). One time was the summer vacation when the freshman ended, and there was a thunderstorm night. I was very excited about the thunderstorm. Because I have never seen such a landscape with a lot of lightning, I took the wind and rain and ran out to take pictures. I said that many people liked and forwarded it. This is the final impression of Hongfu.</p><p><img src=lb1.jpg class=third-img>

Undertale is a pixel-winding RPG with a lot of gameplay innovations, which portrays some very human NPCs like sheep and sans. The whole game is also impressive because of the depiction of human nature (although the protagonist is not a human being in the game), I still remember that the sheep mother was unable to bear the attack when attacking the protagonist, and all the attacks were circumvented. The overall soundtrack is also very good, is a game without a short board and a lot of innovation. To the moon is a boutique game. The whole story is about storytelling. The protagonist works in a company that modifies the dying people so that they can leave the company without regret, enter other people&rsquo;s memories, experience and modify their memories. There are many beautiful scenes inside, and seeing the experiences of others will also make me think about the meaning of life.</p><div class=right-half-img markdown=1><img src=airport_simulator.jpg>
<center>Airport security simulator</center></div><p>The sophomore days were spent in Shahe. Shahe has the best infrastructure in the three campuses of Beiyou because it is a new campus built in the suburbs. The dormitory is a quadruple room with a bed and a table. The school building is much brighter and brighter than Hongfu, and there is a great library (unfortunately we are only open when we are leaving). After the end of the 17-year summer vacation, I returned to school and started the elementary school. The task was to design a course with the title of an airport security check. At that time, although the programming ability was not strong, there were some basic aesthetics. I felt that the C language graphics library easyX and egg suggested by the teacher were not in the eye, with fewer functions, fewer documents, and fewer users. But only with C/C++, Qt is too big and too heavy, so I decided to use OpenGL. Awkwardly using git to manage source code with roommates, they are responsible for logic, I am responsible for UI, and my part has written nearly two thousand lines. Now that I am too lazy to look at the code at that time, it is an exercise to accumulate experience. The sophomore course involves the main areas of the computer, so it took a lot of time to learn, and the big assignments were more interesting. Discrete mathematics, probability theory, and physics are still basic. Later algorithms, formal languages ​​and automata, gauges and curriculum design, operating systems, and embedded systems are relatively hard lessons.</p><p>The curriculum design of computer composition principle is one of my favorite course design, because in the experimental class, the teacher gives us the freedom to write a virtual machine in high-level language, and the instruction set is not limited. I was inspired by my classmates to write an early game console simulator. I found a lot of pits in a few days. The Gameboy&rsquo;s CPU has exceeded my three-week workload, and the documents that were handed down early are not complete. Some games will also be used. The quirks of the machine, so a lot of pits. Fortunately, CHIP-8 was finally discovered and finally implemented. See the <a href=../chip8-emulator/>CHIP-8 emulator</a> for details . I have a natural love for graphics. When I saw the simulator that I wrote for a week or two, the game was successfully downloaded online, and I felt very fulfilled. I thought the operating system would have some challenging assignments (such as writing one myself), but unfortunately, even the difficulty of the course was very easy, disappointing, but fortunately, the final score was higher.</p><p><img src=chip8.jpg alt></p><center>Computer Orgnization Course Design: CHIP-8 virtual machine</center><p>At the end of the sophomore year, there was also an impressive course. Professor Fang Ming&rsquo;s Java and object-oriented. Professor Fang Ming has retired and was hired to come back to give us lectures. He is very good at telling stories and tells a lot about his experiences when he was young, brilliant IBM, software crisis, and backward education in China. They went to receive training from foreign teachers. He also gave us a floppy disk, saying that the office was left to the present. It is said that at that time, it was necessary to carry a system with a large floppy disk and read it into the computer one by one. I feel the texture of the data when I touch the floppy disk. For this reason, I also bought a USB floppy drive, although it is useless (maybe some eggs can be left for those who smashed my floppy disk later?). Unfortunately, his professor&rsquo;s UML has been somewhat outdated, and it is not an elegant design. I have little interest in the content of the course.</p><p><img src=disk_n_drive.jpg alt></p><center>3.5 floppy disk and USB drive</center><p>One thing that has a deep impression is that the two big-scale projects I participated in are unfinished. Now I think of an instructor saying that you can complete the project completely and feel too real. That is the two activities that I took when I was a freshman. One is to do a college English basic writing training platform, and the other is to do a virtual number for privacy protection. Let me talk about the first one. In the third year of the freshman year, the teacher wanted to find a few people to apply for a website that automatically corrects the English platform. It is also for the moral education, and I joined as the main person in charge. After that, you have to worry about a lot of things, including the opening report, the rating report, and the mid-term inspection. Half a semester has passed, and our team has written about the structure of the website. The teacher still did not provide us with data and became a roadblock for the project. After a mid-term inspection with a little frame, I couldn&rsquo;t stand the delay of the teacher. After discussing with the team members, I decided to apply for cancellation of the project. Daiso&rsquo;s various reports are really troublesome. Even the cancellation has to pay some forms. The magic is that I discussed the cancellation with the English teacher. She agreed to apologize to me. Another project is a privacy protection platform based on virtual numbers. When people temporarily park their phones, they should put their phones on the windows, so that people who need to move the car can contact themselves. At this time, they can put virtual numbers to protect their privacy. This main person in charge is a friend. I feel that it is difficult to land (to contact the operator, promote, and later it seems that there is similar software on Alipay), and finally it is no longer, no application to terminate the project, and did not finish the problem. reply.</p><p>I also participated in some activities and competitions as a sophomore. I went to Fuzhou to participate in the CCSP and got the Bronze Award (compared with the contestants or the dishes). I feel that this kind of game involving the computer system is more interesting than the pure algorithmic competition. One question is to let you write a part of the lisp language. The interpreter, and the speed at which you can find ways to speed up the convolution. New Year when playing a game of mathematical modeling the United States, with teammates stayed for three days in Tianjin B & B, recorded in the <a href=../my-first-mcm/>My First MCM</a>. Also participated in the physical competition in the school and Beijing, took the first prize, the full score, very happy.</p><div class=right-third-img markdown=1><img src=ych.jpg>
<center>concert</center></div><p>In 17 years, I went to Tianjin to watch Zhang Xueyou&rsquo;s concert, and by the way, I turned around in Tianda and Nankai. I listened to a lot of Zhang Xueyou&rsquo;s songs in high school. Although I don&rsquo;t hear much now, I can&rsquo;t forget it. It took a while to research and write a Minecraft Mod using Java and MC Forge, a library that decompiles MC and creates a set of interfaces. To be honest, the Java language and MC API experience is not good. Microsoft&rsquo;s bedrock and JS APIs feel much more comfortable. Unfortunately, the Java version of the ecosystem has been built. Too many mods are written in Java. It is hard to return. But the most important thing for the game is the player experience. For me, being able to control the world through programming is a wonderful thing. I realized a one-shot sword, a smashing of all the stones around the 10x10x10 range, and realized the ability of an infinite two-segment jump (N-segment jump). I also fell from the beginning because of the jump too high. , had to cancel the falling damage of the jump. After taking the game elements that I realized myself, the interest in MC came to an end.</p><p><img src=mc_end_poem.jpg alt></p><center>Minecraft: End Poem</center><p>I bught the ipad pro 10.5 at 11.11. The main purpose of the game was to play the sound. There was a table in the dormitory. I bought Deemo and Cytus on ios, and both of them went to customs clearance. At that time, Cytus II was released. It seems that it is still being updated, but the style is not quite right. After the customs clearance, there is no more brush. The ipad&rsquo;s large screen is perfect for music games, and both hands can be deployed. Games like Cytus can only use two thumbs on a small screen. Now I want to use the iPad as a productivity tool and find that its system is too closed. It is still too unfriendly to the programmer. If it can be selected, it may now be more inclined to the same level of Android tablet.</p><p>Sophomore end of the summer, a group of people, including me, sent by the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications at public expense Cambridge University for two weeks, this is my first time abroad, and the details are recorded in <a href=../cambridge-travels/>Cambridge Travels</a>. After returning, I put the focus on the preparation of GRE and TOEFL. This process is still quite painful, memorizing words and brushing questions. It took about three months before and after, and the first time GRE was enough, there were 326 + 3.5. After spending more than a month, I prepared a TOEFL on the basis of GRE, which is enough for World War I. English has spent a lot of time and energy on the junior year, but fortunately, the results are relatively fast, there is no need to test many times of torture.</p><p>Finally, put a picture of the neon scene of the Shahe Campus as the finishing touch for the second year. The panorama of the phone is not very good, bear it.</p><p><img src=20180515_185931.jpg alt></p><center>Neon, there are two laps</center><p>At the beginning of the junior year, I returned to the headquarters. The allocated dormitory was in poor condition. The eight people had a bunk bed. There was no small bathroom. The air conditioning was good. The classes in the experimental class are arranged in well-equipped multimedia classrooms to make people happy. Near the application for going abroad, I also began to pay attention to the results. Unfortunately, at this time, I met some teachers who scored by mood, which led to my computer engineering and postgraduate courses being unbearable. I don&rsquo;t know if I am bad luck or what the teacher is asking for. These things make me feel that Beiyou is not a respectable school, but Beiyou is just a virtual personality, or that those teachers do not have a teacher&rsquo;s morality.</p><p>There are three main things to do this year, classes, English and internships. The courses that feel good are the network, the compilation principle and the database. The rest, such as system structure, software engineering, graph theory, etc., can only say that knowledge is interesting, but it is ruined by the teacher&rsquo;s teaching - if the meaning of education If it is to stimulate students&rsquo; interest, these people are counterproductive.</p><p>The teacher of the network is a friendly Shandong Dahan, and his own technical level is also very good. He wrote an experimental framework and let us design the protocol package format, which is stronger than anyone. Unfortunately, there are too many knowledge points on the syllabus, which leads to chaos in teaching content. The compiling principle sounds very comfortable. I feel that the formal language and automata of the last semester are not white. The teacher also took us through several types of analysis methods, LL, LR and other subtle algorithms, the basis of self-study. Still very satisfying. Teacher Deng Fang, who teaches the database, I like it very much. The lessons in the class are clear and clear, and there is a relatively complete introduction to all aspects of the relational database. The primary school of the latter database also has an option for the experimental class: Previously, it was a web system that used the database, and now you can choose to write a database yourself. I really like this idea, I started writing this thing a long time ago, and I finished the SQL parsing, UI interface, physical plan generation and execution. Later, the elementary school and the roommate were perfected together, adding support for the transaction and log-based rollback. Even if there is a foundation in front of me, I still feel a little bit of a break at the end of the primary school period, and I am still fixing bugs one night before the deadline. The main reason may be that I didn&rsquo;t have a good interface and architecture design at first, although I was able to use it at the time, but with transactions and rollbacks I needed some hacks. It was not enough to refactor in two weeks, so I just had to take it. Fortunately, there was no problem in the final presentation with the teacher. I also showed all the bits and pieces that I had done in the past, which is very satisfying.</p><p>I would like to mention the problem of the results here. From now on, I have encountered many choices between my own preferences and higher grades. For example, database course design, I spent at least two hundred hours of energy to make my own satisfactory results, the teacher is very rigorous, demanding, or gave me 97 points. Compared with the students who chose the design of the network course, as long as they are less than ten hours, writing a DNS server will be able to reach nearly 100 points. There are still many such things, such as public elections, which are courses that you choose to like but give a low score. It is still very boring but gives a high score. There are very few classes that can be considered. In the past few days, I saw a forum posting, asking how to choose a job that likes low wages and a position that does not like it but has a high salary. The question is called &ldquo;How much is the ideal value of young people?&rdquo; What he said is very similar to the dilemma I mentioned. Self-esteem and the spirit of exploration drove me to choose a more challenging course branch, but how many points can these emotions be worth? It may not be as direct as the salary level, but the quality of the results will affect the quality of the postgraduate school, and indirectly affect the job. For me now, the decisive role of performance is much weaker than that of the college entrance examination, so I prefer to choose a more challenging route that I prefer. Even if other students can easily get a better score, I don&rsquo;t regret it, because this is the level that my undergraduate students should have.</p><p>In the third year of the year, I began to look for an internship more eagerly. The main purpose was to apply for a recommendation letter and a rich resume when I went abroad. My first internship was with the team teacher who went to Cambridge, the North China PCN&CAD Lab (I don&rsquo;t know what PCN means so far), and I worked with a senior to make a face clustering project in a mobile photo album. Unfortunately, the level of my seniors is very strong. I don&rsquo;t do much. He finished the project and it is rare to experience the feeling of flying. Later, I did not explicitly say goodbye to the teacher and did not go there again. The second time was the postal architecture laboratory of Beiyou. The teacher gave the introduction to the teacher. At first, I thought it was a deep learning based on the graph. Later I found out that it was just pre-investigation. I was responsible for the segmentation of the streamline. This field is relatively small, so my entry path is also very rough, to use python to call the VTK interface, read the streamline, and then use VTK to display. VTK is a data visualization library written in C++ that integrates many algorithms. Its interface is highly object-oriented, and there are many documents, but it is not very complete in my direction. I think it&rsquo;s over-engineered, and it&rsquo;s a far cry from Python&rsquo;s thinking. However, visualizing a large number of streamlines can only use it, because it has good performance, and other libraries can&rsquo;t afford it. I have accumulated a certain amount of code base here, and started to innovate the streamline segmentation method, but doing it, I found that there is no essential difference between our idea and others. There is no recognized baseline in this field, and it starts to be a little confused. . About this time I found an internship at MSRA, and the time became very tense: I went to class at 8 to 10 in the morning, then reported to the school lab teacher, then went to the company meeting before 11 o&rsquo;clock and got off work at 8 o&rsquo;clock in the evening. After a while, I couldn’t afford to go to the school’s lab and concentrate on my internship.</p><p>Stayed at MSRA for a total of six months, and the direction was to estimate network bandwidth through reinforcement learning. The atmosphere between the interns in the group is very harmonious, and I have a chat together every day. The deepest feeling is that the people around me are quite powerful. For example, a school student of Beihang who left when I came, got the offer of CMU MSCV, and the intern around him is mostly Tsinghua University, and there are many colleges and universities. Dr. Lian Pei. Contact with the people here also made me understand the world of doctors. I was very determined to study for a master&rsquo;s degree, and now I am somewhat shaken.</p><p>One magical and fortunate thing is that I joined an organization called Yiban during my sophomore year. At that time, I was most attracted to a large event room where I could use the Shahe Campus, as well as computers and monitors. During the sophomore year, he developed an app called Help. You can post things that need help, such as picking up the courier and setting up rewards. Others can accept, complete tasks and get rewards. Unfortunately, the project to reorganize the E-Class has gradually become unhealed (people always do), and the app is no longer available. Going back to the front, the right to use the activity room is not so great at the Shahe Campus where you go to bed. At most, there is more than one display screen, and the working environment is better. But what I didn&rsquo;t expect was that there was a similar activity room after returning to the headquarters. It was shared by the North Post team, the new media team, and the Yiban. There were not many local and ordinary people. There is no desk in the dormitory, and it is especially precious to find the headquarters of the self-study classroom. It is a far-than-expected return on investment that is not there every day during the MSRA internship.</p><p>The life of the university is almost over. I remember someone said that the meaning of education is to stimulate students&rsquo; interest in the subject. Others say that the meaning of the university is to help students find the direction of life. From these perspectives, my university is a complete one. In the past three years, I have improved a lot from ignorant high school students. I have learned to respect each individual, more understanding, and less judgment. I believe that even if everything in the universe is meaningless, I must give everything around me the value I perceive and live for the goodness of life. Maybe my understanding of the world will change constantly, but I can always rely on it, it is the constant logic principle, and it is my own sharp thinking. The college entrance examination made me abandon the high school era and headed to the university. Now it seems that there is a lack of a ceremony to move to the next stage. This summary is a commemoration of everything in the past and the beginning of a new life after the university.</p><style>.half-img{width:50%;float:left}.third-img{width:33%;float:left}.left-half-img{width:50%;float:left;margin-right:10px}.left-third-img{width:33%;float:left;margin-right:10px}.right-half-img{width:50%;float:right;margin-left:10px}.right-third-img{width:33%;float:right;margin-left:10px}</style></div><footer></footer></article><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script><script id=MathJax-script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[['$','$'],['\\(','\\)']],processEscapes:true,processEnvironments:true},options:{skipHtmlTags:['script','noscript','style','textarea','pre']}};</script></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>© 2016 - 2023 Sine Liu</p></section></footer></main><script src=https://ssine.ink/js/dark-mode.min.0213e1773e6d1c5a644f847c67a6f8abac49a3776e2976f6008038af8c5b76a1.js></script><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=false;if(!doNotTrack){(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');ga('create','UA-127064931-1','auto');ga('send','pageview');}</script></body></html>
